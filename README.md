What is Ciri?
---------------

Ciri is an ongoing Ethereum implementation written in Ruby. Ciri aims to become a researcher-friendly Ethereum implementation and a blockchain toolbox for all developers to modify or build their own private/public chains more conveniently in Ruby.

The goals of Ciri:

* Be a researcher-friendly Ethereum implementationï¼Œwhich means Ciri needs to be intelligible and easy to be modified.
* Be a blockchain toolbox requests, provide components and low-level API for developers to build their own private or public chain.
* In general, we want Ciri to build a bridge to bring rubyist into Ethereum world!

Where will this project go?
---------------

Ciri has already passed the Ethereum tests suite and the Ethereum 1.0 POW Chain is almost implemented. However, we still need to implement several components(DevP2P, KeyStore, CLI ...) to support running a fully functionally Ethereum node on the mainnet.

At the same time, we are keeping an eye on Ethereum 2.0 specs: the shasper(sharding + casper) implementation, and pursuing to implement the lastest updated shasper specs.

Ciri project wants more contributors and we highly welcome anyone to join in. If you are interested in Ciri project, please refer to [How to learn Ethereum and contribute to Ciri](https://github.com/ciri-ethereum/ciri/wiki#how-to-learn-ethereum-and-contribute-to-ciri) and [Issues](https://github.com/ciri-ethereum/ciri/issues).

Read [projects](https://github.com/ciri-ethereum/ciri/projects) and [milestones](https://github.com/ciri-ethereum/ciri/milestones) for current development status.

See our [Roadmap](https://github.com/ciri-ethereum/ciri/wiki) on Wiki.

Usage
---------------

Ciri is still under active development and the master branch is really recommended.

Add this line to your Gemfile:

``` ruby
gem 'ciri', github: 'ciri-ethereum/ciri'
```

See [examples](https://github.com/ciri-ethereum/ciri).

Development
---------------

Ciri depends on [rocksdb](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb), [secp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1), [ethash](https://github.com/ethereum/ethash) and [snappy](https://github.com/google/snappy).

It's a recommendation to [setup with docker](#setup-with-docker) because it will help to save lots of time.

### Setup with docker

Use docker command to pull image:

``` bash
docker pull ciriethereum/ciri
```

Or you can use our prepared rake tasks if you're not familiar with docker:

clone repo and submodules

``` bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ciri-ethereum/ciri.git
cd ciri
```

make sure we have installed docker, ruby and rake
``` bash
# make sure we have installed docker, ruby and rake
docker -v
gem install rake
```

#### Pull docker image

``` bash
# pull Ciri docker image
rake docker:pull
```

#### Build docker image
(it will take a few minutes)
``` bash
# build Ciri docker image
rake docker:build
```

#### Run tests in docker
``` bash
# run tests
rake docker:quick
```

#### Other usages
``` bash
# open a shell for developing
rake docker:shell

# type 'rake -T' see other supported tasks 
rake -T
``` 

### Manually Setup

clone repo and submodules

``` bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ciri-ethereum/ciri.git
```

#### Install dependencies

On a mac you can install `rocksdb` and `snappy` with homebrew

``` bash
brew install rocksdb snappy
```

then manually install

ethash
``` bash
cd ethash/src/libethash && cmake CMakeLists.txt && make install
```

secp256k1
``` bash
cd secp256k1 && ./autogen.sh && ./configure --enable-module-recovery --enable-experimental --enable-module-ecdh && make && make install
```

For linux users, remember to check [Dockerfile](/docker) instructions for hint.

then run: 
``` bash
bundle install
```

run tests:
``` bash
RUBY_THREAD_VM_STACK_SIZE=52428800 bundle exec rake quick
```

Why Ruby?
---------------

> Because Ruby has its own built-in block support!

Seriously, 

Ruby is a scripting language which makes it easy to write prototype or research code (like the official python Ethereum implementation intended).

According to the several performance research projects in Ruby community (JIT, JRuby, TruffleRuby), we are highly looking forward to seeing improvement of this language performance in the future. 

Due to Ruby, we could expect to achieve both research-friendly and high-performance in our implementation.
