Ciri project intent to implement a full feature set ethereum client.

It aims to be a feature complete, long maintained and stable ethereum client.
As you see it'is still under development.

Talk to me on [gitter](https://gitter.im/ciri-ethereum/Lobby) if you interesting in this project or want to contributing.

See [projects](https://github.com/ciri-ethereum/ciri/projects) and [milestones](https://github.com/ciri-ethereum/ciri/milestones) for current development status.

Roadmap
---------------

See [Wiki Roadmap](https://github.com/ciri-ethereum/ciri/wiki)

Installation
---------------

See [develop](#develop) section

Usage
---------------

`ciri -h`

Develop
---------------

Ciri depends on [rocksdb](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb), [secp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1), [ethash](https://github.com/ethereum/ethash) and [snappy](https://github.com/google/snappy).

It's recommended to use docker to handle dependencies:
``` bash
# make sure we have installed docker, ruby and rake
docker -v
gem install rake

# pull Ciri base image
rake docker:pull_base
# run tests
rake docker:test
# open a shell for develop
rake docker:shell

# cool, type 'rake -T' see other supported tasks 
``` 
 
Otherwise you need install these libraries manually (remember check [docker](/docker) directory for hint).

then run: 
`bundle install && bundle exec rake`
